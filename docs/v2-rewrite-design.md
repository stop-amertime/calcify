# calcite v2 — clean-rewrite design

**Status:** in progress, branch `calcite-v2-rewrite`. Companion to
[`compiler-mission.md`](compiler-mission.md). Parallel stream to the
additive `calcite-v2` worktree; the two streams will be reconciled by
the project owner. This doc is the v2-rewrite stream's contract.

## What "stream 2" is

A clean rewrite of the calcite pipeline from parser output to codegen.
v1 stays in the tree as a conformance backstop. The end state is:

```
ParsedProgram → v2 DAG → v2 idiom recognisers → DAG codegen → execute
```

No `Vec<Op>` in the pipeline. No dependency on v1's `pattern/` module
at runtime. v1's interpreter stays callable — for differential tests
during development and as a backstop after — but is not on the hot
path.

The constraints everything else lives under: the cardinal rule
(CSS-generic, no x86 knowledge, Chrome is ground truth) and bit-
identical results vs Chrome on the Phase 0.5 primitive conformance
suite. v1 is a faster proxy for Chrome that is useful for differential
testing, but it is **not** a peer implementation we are matching — if
Chrome and v1 disagree, we match Chrome.

## Why this stream chooses ParsedProgram, not Vec<Op>

The additive stream's [`phase1-dag-ir.md`](../../calcite-v2/docs/phase1-dag-ir.md)
chose `Vec<Op>` (post-compile bytecode) as the source IR, on the
reasoning that Op is already SSA-shaped and that v1's pattern lowerings
are already encoded in the Op stream "for free."

This stream rejects that choice for one decisive reason: **building on
top of v1's Op stream inherits v1's pattern-recognition decisions.** v1
decided where dispatch chains live, what gets broadcast-collapsed, where
packed reads happen, where word-pair fusion lands. A clean rewrite
should make those decisions in a substrate designed for the eventual
codegen target — not be downstream of them.

Concretely: v1's broadcast recogniser fires only when a property's
expression has a specific `if(style())` cascade shape. The Doom8088
cabinet fast-path absorbs ≥1MB of `--mN: …` before they ever reach
`Expr` form (see `parser/fast_path.rs`); v2 building from the Op stream
sees those as already-collapsed `Op::CompiledBroadcastWrite` super-ops,
inheriting whatever scope and gate-extraction rules v1 chose. Building
from `ParsedProgram` (with the prebuilt fast-path tables surfaced as
data, not as opaque ops) lets v2 redo those choices — or skip them —
freely.

## Source IR

`ParsedProgram` (parser output) is the v2 DAG's source IR. The v2 DAG
builder consumes:

- `properties: Vec<PropertyDef>` — `@property` declarations. Used to
  set up the slot map; not lowered to DAG nodes directly.
- `functions: Vec<FunctionDef>` — `@function` definitions. Each
  function's body is an Expr tree; lowered to a per-function sub-DAG
  rooted at the result expression.
- `assignments: Vec<Assignment>` — top-level `--prop: <expr>`
  assignments on `.cpu`. Each lowers to a `WriteVar(slot, dag_node)`.
- `prebuilt_broadcast_writes: Vec<BroadcastWrite>` — broadcast-write
  entries the parser fast-path absorbed before Expr trees were built.
  These are surfaced as data structures, not ops, and the DAG builder
  emits an `IndirectStore` super-node per port directly.
- `prebuilt_packed_broadcast_ports: Vec<PackedSlotPort>` — same shape
  for packed (`PACK_SIZE=2`) cabinets.
- `fast_path_absorbed: HashSet<String>` — property names already
  consumed by the fast-path. The DAG builder filters these out of the
  assignment loop so they aren't double-counted.

**No re-parse, no fast-path disable knob.** The fast-path is a
performance optimisation for parser throughput on huge cabinets
(Doom8088 is ~30 MB of CSS); rebuilding Expr trees for every memory
cell would cost ≥10× parse time. The fast-path output is structurally
a `BroadcastWrite { dest, address_map, gate, ... }` value — equivalent
information to what an Expr cascade encodes — so v2 takes the same
shape from either source.

This also means v1's `pattern/broadcast_write.rs` and
`pattern/packed_broadcast_write.rs` recognisers are still useful at
build time: they cover the residual `Expr`-form broadcast assignments
the fast-path didn't catch (small cabinets, non-CSS-DOS emitters, and
anything below the 1 MB fast-path threshold). v2 may keep calling them
as helpers during DAG construction, classified as "v1 code that stays
callable as a backstop" (see § What v1 code stays callable below).

## DAG node vocabulary

Refined against the actual `Expr` and `CalcOp` enums in
[`crates/calcite-core/src/types.rs`](../crates/calcite-core/src/types.rs).
Phase 1 lands the **pure expression nodes** plus the **side-effecting
nodes**; the **super-nodes** are Phase 2 deliverables but listed here
so Phase 1 doesn't paint into a corner.

### Pure expression nodes

| Node | Lowers from | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| `Lit(f64)` | `Expr::Literal` | f64 to match parser; codegen narrows to i32. |
| `LitStr(String)` | `Expr::StringLiteral` | Only used by string-syntax props (textBuffer). |
| `LoadVar { slot, kind: TickPosition }` | `Expr::Var { name, .. }` (resolved) | One node covers both "this tick" and "previous tick" reads. `kind` is `Current` for `--foo`, `Prev` for `--__1foo` / `--__2foo`. The walker uses `kind` to choose between the per-tick property cache and committed state — see § State model. |
| `Calc { op, args }` | `Expr::Calc(CalcOp::*)` | Generic arithmetic. Op enum mirrors `CalcOp`: Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Mod, Min, Max, Clamp, Round(strategy), Pow, Sign, Abs, Neg. |
| `FuncCall { fn_id, args }` | `Expr::FunctionCall { name, .. }` (all calls, Phase 1) | Pure call. The function body is its own sub-DAG. **Phase 1 lowers every `FunctionCall` to `FuncCall` — no name-based fast-path.** v1's `FunctionPattern` enum classifies by body shape (Bitmask, RightShift, BitExtract, IdentityRead, …), which is more general than name matching and is the right model. v2 promotes that to a Phase 2 idiom-recogniser pass that emits `BitOp`/`BitField` super-nodes from body shape, regardless of `@function` name. |
| `If { branches: Vec<(StyleCondNode, NodeId)>, fallback: NodeId }` | `Expr::StyleCondition { branches, fallback }` | Branch-shape conditional. Phase 2 collapses long branches into `Switch`. |
| `StyleCond { property: SlotId, value: NodeId }` | `StyleTest::Single` | Note: a `StyleTest` is only meaningful as the predicate of a branch — it's not a full DAG node, but a sub-AST attached to `If` branches. |
| `StyleAnd(Vec<StyleCondNode>)`, `StyleOr(...)` | `StyleTest::And` / `StyleTest::Or` | Same — sub-AST of `If`. |
| `Concat(Vec<NodeId>)` | `Expr::Concat` | String concatenation. Display path only. |

### Side-effecting nodes

| Node | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `WriteVar { slot, value: NodeId }` | One per top-level `Assignment`. The DAG's terminal nodes — every dependency root reaches one. |

### Super-nodes (Phase 2)

| Node | Captures |
|------|----------|
| `Switch { key: NodeId, table: TableId, fallback: NodeId }` | Catalogue idiom 1. Long `if(style(--P: N))` chains. |
| `IndirectStore { gate: Option<NodeId>, addr: NodeId, val: NodeId, width: NodeId, region: RegionId, pack: u8 }` | Catalogue idioms 3+4+5+7. Broadcast write, packed or unpacked, gated, with optional word-pair width. |
| `Hold { slot }` | Catalogue idiom 8. `--x: var(--__1x)`. |
| `Mux { cases: Vec<(StyleCondNode, NodeId)>, fallback: NodeId }` | Catalogue idiom 9. Small priority cascades (TF/IRQ override). |
| `BitField { src: NodeId, shift: u8, mask: u32 }` | Catalogue idiom 11. Lowered from `(x >> n) & mask` shapes. |

`StyleCondNode` is a tiny sub-IR (`Single { slot, value: NodeId }`,
`And(Vec<StyleCondNode>)`, `Or(Vec<StyleCondNode>)`); not a top-level
DAG node because it never produces a value, only gates one.

The DAG itself is `Vec<DagNode>` indexed by `NodeId`. Each tick = one
topological evaluation pass. Cross-tick dataflow flows through `LoadPrev
→ … → WriteVar` chains where the `WriteVar`'s slot is the same one
`LoadPrev` reads next tick.

## Lowering rules — Expr → DagNode

Direct, mechanical, no idiom recognition (Phase 1):

1. **Slot map.** Built from `properties` after `state.load_properties`,
   keyed by *bare* property name (no `--` prefix, no `__0`/`__1`/`__2`
   prefix — those prefixes are structural and don't denote a separate
   slot; they denote *which tick's value of the same slot* to read).
   See § State model for the slot/address scheme.

2. **`Expr::Literal(v)` → `Lit(v)`.**

3. **`Expr::StringLiteral(s)` → `LitStr(s)`.**

4. **`Expr::Var { name, fallback }` → `LoadVar { slot, kind }`.**
   - The triple-buffer convention (see § State model § The CSS
     contract) maps `--foo`, `--__0foo`, `--__1foo`, `--__2foo` to
     the same logical slot at different temporal positions. v2's
     lowering reflects that:
     - Strip the `--` prefix; if `__0`/`__1`/`__2` follows, set
       `kind = Prev` and strip the buffer prefix.
     - Otherwise `kind = Current`.
   - Slot resolution:
     1. Look up the bare name in the slot map.
     2. If found → emit `LoadVar { slot, kind }`. The fallback is
        unreachable in CSS terms because the property is declared
        and always has a value; discard it.
     3. If not found and `fallback` is present → lower the fallback
        expression and emit *that* node. CSS spec: `var(--undef, X)`
        evaluates to `X`.
     4. If not found and no fallback → emit `Lit(0)`. CSS spec:
        unresolved `var()` falls through to the property's
        registered initial value (0 for `<integer>` syntax, our
        sole numeric type).

5. **`Expr::Calc(op)` → `Calc { op, args: lowered }`.** Map each
   `CalcOp` variant 1:1 to a `Calc` op kind. Arity matches.

6. **`Expr::FunctionCall { name, args }` → `FuncCall { fn_id, args: lowered }`.**
   No name-based fast-path in Phase 1. The function body is its own
   sub-DAG keyed by `fn_id`, rooted at the function's `result`
   expression. Phase 2's idiom recogniser will classify function
   bodies by *shape* (e.g. `mod(a, pow(2, b))` → bitmask;
   `round(down, a / pow(2, b))` → right shift) and replace recognised
   shapes with `BitOp`/`BitField`/`Switch` super-nodes. Body-shape
   matching is cardinal-rule stronger than name matching: any
   `@function` whose body is a bitmask gets the same fast-path,
   regardless of whether it's named `--and`, `--mask8`, or
   `--myUserDefinedHelper`.

7. **`Expr::StyleCondition { branches, fallback }` → `If { branches:
   lowered, fallback: lowered }`.** Each branch's `StyleTest` lowers to
   a `StyleCondNode`; each branch's `then` lowers to a `NodeId`. A
   `StyleTest::Single { property, value: Expr }` lowers to
   `StyleCondNode::Single { slot: slot_of(property), value: lowered_node }`
   — the value side is itself a `NodeId` even though in practice it's
   almost always a literal. The walker then evaluates both sides and
   compares.

8. **`Expr::Concat(parts)` → `Concat(lowered)`.**

### Top-level assignment lowering

For each `Assignment { property, value }` in
`program.assignments`:

- **Skip if** the property name starts with `--__0`, `--__1`, or
  `--__2`. These assignments implement the CSS triple-buffer copy
  (e.g. `--__1mN: var(--__2mN, init)`) — they shift the per-slot
  history back one tick. The walker reconstructs the same shifted
  history from the `LoadVar { kind: Prev }` mechanism (see § State
  model § What `LoadVar { kind }` means), so the literal copy is
  redundant. Eliding it produces identical observable end-of-tick
  state — the buffered values are still visible to next tick's
  `--__1foo` reads, just retrieved differently.

- **Skip if** the property is in `program.fast_path_absorbed` or in
  the absorbed-properties set returned by
  `pattern::broadcast_write::recognise_broadcast` /
  `pattern::packed_broadcast_write::recognise_packed_broadcast` on
  `program.assignments`. These assignments are still evaluated, just
  via the `IndirectStore` super-node instead of an individual
  `WriteVar` per cell — the observable state is the same.

- **Otherwise**, lower `value` to a `NodeId` and emit
  `WriteVar { slot: slot_of(property), value }`.

The DAG's terminal nodes are the union of:

- `WriteVar` per non-skipped, non-absorbed assignment.
- `IndirectStore` per `prebuilt_broadcast_write` and per
  `prebuilt_packed_broadcast_port`.
- `IndirectStore` per recogniser-found broadcast write.

For each `prebuilt_broadcast_write` and `prebuilt_packed_broadcast_port`
the DAG builder emits the Phase 2 super-node directly:
`IndirectStore { gate, addr, val, width, region, pack }`. Phase 1's
walker has to evaluate it, which is fine — its semantics are well-
defined and don't require any Phase 2 recogniser to fire. (This is the
one place where Phase 1 emits a super-node despite "no recognition" —
it's the cheaper alternative to re-parsing 30 MB of memory cells.)

## State model and tick semantics

### The CSS contract

Chrome is the spec. CSS evaluates all custom-property assignments on a
single element *simultaneously* against the values they had on the
prior style computation. There is no "before" or "after" within a
tick — every `var(--foo)` reference resolves against the same
prior-tick value pool, and every `--foo: <expr>` assignment commits
into the next-tick value pool. There is no read-write ordering
question because there are no sequenced reads or writes.

The cabinet uses a *triple-buffer* convention to make multi-tick state
visible:

- `--mN` — the new value computed this tick.
- `--__1mN` — the previous tick's `--mN` value.
- `--__2mN` — two ticks ago.

Three structural CSS shapes implement the buffer pipeline:

1. `--mN: if(<this-tick write rules>; else: var(--__1mN))` — compute
   the new value, falling back to last tick's value (hold).
2. `--__1mN: var(--__2mN, init)` — copy the second-tick-back to the
   one-tick-back slot.
3. `--__2mN` carries forward by Chrome's normal cascade.

When all three assignments evaluate simultaneously against the prior
tick's pool, the end-of-tick state has each `--mN` updated and each
`--__1mN` / `--__2mN` shifted back one position. Open the cabinet in
Chrome and this is what happens.

### What v2 has to produce

Same observable end-of-tick state as Chrome would produce on the same
CSS. Nothing else.

### How v2 produces it

The walker's contract is *observable end-of-tick state matches what
Chrome would produce on the same CSS*. The mechanism is implementation
choice — Phase 1 picks one and gates against Chrome.

Two viable mechanisms, both correct:

**(a) Two-pool snapshot.** Prior pool (read-only, populated at tick
start) and next pool (write-only, populated by `WriteVar`). Every
`var(...)` reads from prior; every assignment writes to next; pools
swap at tick end. This is the literal simultaneous-evaluation
semantics. Cost: one slot-array clone per tick.

**(b) Cache-plus-topological-sort.** Maintain a per-tick cache that
each `WriteVar` populates and each `LoadVar` reads with fall-through
to committed state. Sort assignments so writers come before readers
on every current-tick edge. `--__1*` reads bypass the cache and read
committed state directly. Cost: one topo sort at compile time, one
cache reset per tick.

Both produce CSS-consistent observable state on every cabinet shape
the kiln emits. Choice depends on perf and walker complexity. Phase 1
sub-task: prototype both, gate against Chrome (Phase 0.5 conformance
suite), pick the simpler one if perf is comparable.

### Slot map

State vars and memory bytes share v1's unified index space (negative
addresses for state vars, non-negative for memory). v2 reuses
`State`'s storage and slot allocation directly so committed state is
exchangeable across walker boundaries. v2 does not invent a separate
slot allocation.

### What `LoadVar { kind }` means in the IR

`kind` is a *lowering hint*, not a runtime mode:

- `Current` is lowered from a bare `--foo` reference. In CSS terms
  this is "read `--foo`'s value as the simultaneous-evaluation pool
  has it." In a two-pool walker, that's the prior pool. In a
  cache-plus-sort walker, that's the cache (post-sort, the cache
  holds this-tick's value because the writer fired first).
- `Prev` is lowered from `--__0` / `--__1` / `--__2` prefixed
  references. The triple-buffer convention means these resolve to the
  same slot but at a different temporal position. The walker's job is
  to return whatever value Chrome would return — which, given the
  buffer-copy mechanism Chrome uses, is the slot's value as of N
  ticks ago for the `--__N` prefix.

Phase 1 sub-task: confirm against Chrome (Phase 0.5 suite) what
`var(--__1mN)` returns when an assignment to `--mN` exists earlier in
the same `.cpu` block. CSS spec says the read sees the prior tick's
`--mN`. Pin that as the v2 contract. The walker's mechanism (two-pool,
cache-plus-sort, or otherwise) just has to deliver it.

## Phase 1 acceptance gates

The contract is **Chrome is the oracle**. Every gate either runs CSS
through Chrome and compares, or runs a check that doesn't depend on
v1's behaviour.

Gates that have to pass before Phase 2 starts:

1. **Phase 0.5 primitive conformance suite passes against v2.** The
   suite is small `.css` snippets, each exercising one CSS primitive
   (`var()`, `calc()`, `if(style())`, math functions, edge cases),
   with expected post-evaluation state derived from Chrome via
   Playwright `getComputedStyle`. Port from
   `.claude/worktrees/calcite-v2/` (where it was authored for the
   additive stream) or build fresh — see § Open questions.

   This is the *direct* test of the cardinal-rule contract:
   "calcite produces the same results Chrome would." It catches
   primitive-level divergences that whole-cabinet tests can only
   catch transitively through framebuffer drift.

2. **`cargo test -p calcite-core` green** with v2 selected. Existing
   integration tests are pre-existing on `main` and gate the
   `Evaluator` API — they don't gate v2 semantics directly, but they
   must keep passing.

3. **`wasm-pack build crates/calcite-wasm --target web`** succeeds
   with no errors. The walker compiles for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

Diagnostic tools, not gates:

- **v1 differential.** Running v1 and v2 on the same cabinet and
  diffing end-of-tick state is a useful fast smoke check during
  development — when it disagrees with v2, *one of them* is wrong vs
  Chrome and the diff localises which assignment diverged. But "v2
  matches v1" is not the contract. If v1 has a quirk Chrome doesn't,
  v2 should diverge from v1 there. The Phase 0.5 suite is what
  decides which side is right.

- **Cabinet smoke run.** Loading a real cabinet (`output/rogue.css`
  if it exists, else a `tests/fixtures/*.css`) and running for N
  ticks under v2 without panic is a useful "does the walker handle
  shapes that exist in the wild" check. Crashes are bugs; state
  divergence vs v1 is a Phase 0.5 question, not a gate.

- **No perf regression** on `calcite-bench` with v1 (default
  backend). v2 ships dormant in Phase 1; if it's pulling shared
  helpers that slow v1, that's a bug. Catch with `cargo bench` before
  and after.

## What v1 code stays callable as a backstop

Stays callable, no rename, no deletion:

- `parser::*` — parse to `ParsedProgram`, including the fast-path. v2
  consumes the same output v1 does.
- `pattern::broadcast_write::recognise_broadcast` and
  `pattern::packed_broadcast_write::recognise_packed_broadcast` —
  called by v2 during DAG construction to recognise Expr-form broadcast
  shapes the parser fast-path didn't catch. (v2 *uses* these results
  rather than re-implementing the same matchers; the cardinal-rule
  contract is preserved because the matchers are pure CSS-shape over
  Expr.)
- `pattern::dispatch_table::recognise_dispatch` — same: v2 calls it
  during Switch super-node construction in Phase 2.
- `state::State` — no changes. Slot model is shared.
- `eval::property_to_address` and the global address map — shared.

What v2 **does not** call:

- `compile::*` — the Vec<Op> compiler. v2 produces a DAG, not ops.
- `eval::Evaluator::tick` and `exec_ops` — v1's interpreter. The v2
  walker is a separate code path.
- `pattern::fusion_sim::*` — v1's bytecode-fusion experiments. Phase 3
  codegen is its own thing.

The split: v2 is the new evaluator, derived from CSS. v1 stays in the
tree as a backstop and as a fast smoke-check oracle during
development, but it is not a peer implementation v2 has to match.
Where they disagree, Chrome decides. Both consume the same
`ParsedProgram` and read/write the same `State`, which is why running
them side-by-side on the same cabinet is cheap and useful as a
diagnostic.

## Cardinal-rule audit

The DAG node vocabulary above contains zero x86, BIOS, DOS, or cabinet-
specific concepts. Every node corresponds to a CSS structural element:

- `Lit`, `LoadVar` (Current/Prev), `Calc`, `BitOp`, `FuncCall`, `If`,
  `Concat` — direct from CSS spec / `Expr` enum.
- `WriteVar` — direct from `Assignment` (a CSS top-level declaration).
- `Switch`, `IndirectStore`, `Hold`, `Mux`, `BitField` — all motivated
  by structural CSS shapes (catalogue idioms 1, 3-5+7, 8, 9, 11). Each
  has a documented genericity probe in
  [`phase2-idiom-catalogue.md`](../../calcite-v2/docs/phase2-idiom-catalogue.md).

Operational test: a calcite engineer who has never seen a CPU emulator
can derive every node above from CSS spec + `Expr` enum + the catalogue
of idioms CSS forces emitters into. None of them require knowing what
the cabinet computes.

## Wasm safety audit

- DAG nodes are plain enums + Vec<NodeId> + HashMap<String, SlotId>.
  No `std::time`, no threads, no fs/net, no `std::env` writes.
- The walker is pure data-structure traversal. The optional profile
  scope wrappers (matching v1) use `web_time::Instant`.
- Compile-time DAG construction reads `ParsedProgram` and writes a
  `Dag`. No I/O, no concurrency.

## Open questions to resolve before Phase 1 lands

1. **Phase 0.5 primitive conformance suite — port or build fresh.**
   The suite is the Phase 1 correctness gate. The additive worktree
   (`.claude/worktrees/calcite-v2/`) reportedly has it. Phase 1
   sub-task: locate it, port to this worktree, run against v2 once
   the walker exists. If the additive version is incomplete, build
   fresh from the catalogue of CSS primitives the cabinets use
   (per `compiler-mission.md` § Phase 0.5).

2. **Walker mechanism: two-pool vs cache-plus-sort.** Both produce
   CSS-consistent results (see § State model). Phase 1 sub-task:
   prototype one, gate against Phase 0.5, switch if Phase 0.5 fails
   in a way the other mechanism would catch. Default: cache-plus-
   sort, because it reuses `State` directly with no per-tick clone.

3. **Whether to call v1's `recognise_broadcast` directly or
   reimplement.** v1's recognisers operate on `Expr` shape, not on
   v1's bytecode — so calling them is using shape-matching code, not
   inheriting v1's bytecode decisions. Default: call v1's, on the
   grounds that broadcast-shape recognition is the same job either
   way and there's no value in two implementations. The cardinal-
   rule contract is preserved as long as the recogniser's matcher is
   pure CSS-shape over `Expr` (which it is — see
   `pattern/broadcast_write.rs:61`).

## File layout

```
crates/calcite-core/src/dag/
  mod.rs           Public entry: build_dag(&ParsedProgram, &State) -> Dag.
  types.rs         DagNode, NodeId, SlotId, StyleCondNode, Dag.
  lowering.rs      Expr → DagNode. Mechanical, no idiom recognition.
  walker.rs        walk(&Dag, &mut State) — one tick of evaluation.
```

Phase 1 unit tests live alongside the module (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`
in `lowering.rs`). End-to-end tests against Chrome (the Phase 0.5
suite) and against v1 (smoke diagnostic) live under
`crates/calcite-core/tests/`.

The `Evaluator` gains a `backend: Backend` field and a `Dag` alongside
`compiled`. `tick()` dispatches on the backend at construction time
(set once in `from_parsed`, never branched per-tick).

## What this design explicitly excludes

These are real things that *will* happen — just not in Phase 1:

- DAG-level CSE, constant folding, dead-code elimination — Phase 2.
- Cross-block code motion or scheduling — Phase 3 codegen.
- Any change to `compile.rs`, v1's pattern recognisers' internals, or
  `State`.
- Replacing `Evaluator::tick` as the default — both backends ship side
  by side until Phase 3 retires the old one.
